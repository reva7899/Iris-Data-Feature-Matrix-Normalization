# Iris-Data-Feature-Matrix-Normalization
In this repositry, how to normalize the feature matrix of the Iris dataset and calculate the correlation matrix for each class 

Normalization is a technique used to rescale the values of the features so that they have the same scale and are comparable.it is show how to normalize the feature matrix such that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 after normalization. This can be achieved by subtracting the mean of each feature from all the values of that feature and then dividing by the standard deviation of that feature. This will ensure that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 after normalization.

Once you have normalized the feature matrix, now we need to calculate the correlation matrix for each class. The correlation matrix will show how strongly each feature is related to the others after normalization. The values in the correlation matrix will range from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, a value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and a value of 0 indicates no correlation.

By normalizing the feature matrix and calculating the correlation matrix for each class, you can gain a better understanding of the relationships between the features and how they contribute to each class. This information can be useful for further analysis or for building predictive models.
